# poverty_climate_model_public
Public version of the model used in Shockwaves (without protected data)

This is the code of the model used to produce the results of the Shockwaves report https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/22787 and of the article Climate change through a poverty lens by Stephane Hallegatte & Julie Rozenberg published in Nature Climate Change 7, 250â€“256 (2017) doi:10.1038/nclimate3253.

The model is based on a database of household surveys that is not public. This data cannot be shared, so anyone who would like to use this code should adapt it to their own data. Any question can be addressed to julie.rozenberg@gmail.com

The model is launched with run_model.py
